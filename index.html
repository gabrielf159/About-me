    <p>My name is Gabriel Flores. I am an undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.csusb.edu/">CSUSB</a> pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science. I first became interested in Computer Science in 2019 when I took a programming class for fun during my senior year of high school.This class was taught in Java where I made a mini home-run derby simulator which sparked my interest for the field. <br><br>
    The first language I learned was Java, but throughout my time at CSUSB I have
    learned other languages such as C++, Python, and JavaScript. I have also taken Web Development and Platform Computing courses where I expanded my skillset to include HtML, CSS, Swift, Dart, and SQL. These languages and skills have allowed me to operate in different frameworks such as React, Flutter, Xcode, and Svelte.<br><br>
    My interests are in Data Science and App Development. My goals post gradtuation are to work as a DataScientist or Developer.</p>
